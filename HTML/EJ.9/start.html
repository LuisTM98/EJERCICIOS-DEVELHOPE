    <h2><b><u>Advices on how to habituate to programming</u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Hi! Programming is difficult! That's it, that's all I had to say folks. I'll see you in the next entry.
      
      <br><br><br><br>...now, that's no fun right? <br>

      <h3><i>This is an entry on how I habituated to programming and what I do conceive as improvements.</i></h3>
    </p>

      <h2>[ OBJECTS ]</h2>
      <h3>The Chair</h3>
      <p>
        Who said we should leave the best for the last?
        One of the most important things on the programming, is precisely, the place where you're programming. That penta-wheeled confy chair where you can spin during hours if that grants you the ability to not do your work at all.
        That thing must be confortable, must adequate to your back, must be confy and has to be reclining. You must be able to stretch on it. If you can't, then is best to throw it away.
      </p>
      <h3>The computer</h3>

      <p>
        Lets face it: a desktop pc is not much of a good partner. Sitting in the same spot all day without moving, it forces you to do the same. To sit along him all day long while you do your work.
        In my particular view, and much in the current times, the best option for programming is a Laptop. A laptop capable enough, which has power but also has mobility, lets you program in a much wider set of positions, places, etc.
        With a good chair, you can program seated the largest part of the day, but let's face it: being seated all day is not suitable to the long range. With a laptop, you can program in body to ground ON your desk, without much problem.
        The most repetitive work of the world better have versatility in the how-to. 
      </p>
      
    <h2>[ ENVIRONMENT ]</h2>
    <h3>Noises.</h3>
      <p>
        I am a hardcore defender of the absolute silence. You must be able to acknowledge a cooldown in the temperature of the room by hearing the difference in the acoustics of your keyboard due to lowered levels in the pression of the air in that room due to that very cooldown.
      </p>
    <h3>When working from home...</h3>
      <p>
        Do NOT work in the same room you do other things. While possible, select a room different from you do anything related to first necessities (like eating or spleeping) and/or related to idle techno.
        Normally, working in other place as an offices avoids the frustration this thing causes, but the trouble is that places are VERY noisy. Working from home can be ideal in the noise section, but do NOT merge spaces.
